# Code conventions

Rules for how code is written across the assertion family (`LogAssertions.TUnit`,
`SnapshotAssertions.TUnit`, `TimeAssertions.TUnit`, `MathAssertions.TUnit`,
`JsonAssertions.TUnit`, `SseAssertions.TUnit`, and `GrpcAssertions.TUnit`). The same file is copied identically
into each repo.

**Document version:** v0.8 (2026-06-02). Changes from v0.7:

- **Family roster expanded to seven packages.** `GrpcAssertions.TUnit` joins as the
  seventh member, asserting on gRPC call outcomes (`RpcException` presence, `StatusCode`,
  and `Status.Detail`) as a strict-scope-distinct transport domain from `JsonAssertions.TUnit`
  and `SseAssertions.TUnit`. The cap revision 6 → 7 was justified by strict-scope analysis on
  a known-distinct domain (per the per-package scope policy below), not by adoption-growth
  reasoning.
- **Dependency policy added.** `GrpcAssertions.TUnit` is the first family package to carry a
  disclosed external runtime dependency, the permissive Apache-2.0 `Grpc.Core.Api`, intrinsic
  because the assertions are typed against the consumer's real `RpcException` / `StatusCode` /
  `Status`. The new "Dependency policy" section below states the bar for any such dependency.

**Document version:** v0.7 (2026-05-17). Changes from v0.6:

- **Family roster expanded to six packages.** `SseAssertions.TUnit` joins as the sixth
  member, handling Server-Sent Events (SSE) as a strict-scope-distinct domain from
  `JsonAssertions.TUnit`. The cap revision 5 → 6 was justified by strict-scope analysis on
  a known-distinct domain (per the per-package scope policy below), not by adoption-growth
  reasoning. The cap is reviewed before each revision; the goal is "high-quality niche",
  not exhaustive ecosystem coverage.
- **Per-package strict-scope policy formalised.** Each package has an explicit scope
  statement that bounds what domain it asserts on; the policy keeps the family decoupled
  by domain and prevents scope creep between packages. See the new "Per-package strict-scope
  policy" section below.
- **Core+adapter packaging rule clarified.** Each family package chooses single-package or
  core+adapter at v0.0.1; the choice is per-package and is documented in each package's
  README. See the new "Core+adapter packaging rule" section below.

**Document version:** v0.6 (2026-05-16). Changes from v0.5: added the **Cross-package
references rule** and the **Naming invariant** as family-wide architectural invariants.
Both are pack-time-enforced via NuGet dependency list scan + PublicAPI prefix scan;
`JsonAssertions.TUnit` v0.3.0 is the first package to ship the enforcement infrastructure;
the 4 sibling repos adopt the same `CONVENTIONS.md` v0.6 immediately after v0.3.0 merges.

**Document version:** v0.5 (2026-05-15). Changes from v0.4: added the **CHANGELOG conventions**
section (Keep a Changelog 1.1.0 standard headers, user-facing-only content, header order,
stylistic rules) and the **`PackageReleaseNotes` auto-extract** convention that ties the
per-version CHANGELOG section to nuget.org's Release Notes tab via a shared
`Directory.Build.targets` build extension.

**Document version:** v0.4 (2026-05-14). Changes from v0.3: added `JsonAssertions.TUnit` to
the family roster (the fifth package; JSON path / value / shape assertions over
`System.Text.Json`).

**Document version:** v0.3 (2026-05-12). Changes from v0.2: added the `SnapshotAssertions.Render`
namespace reservation for sibling-package text renderers so consumers discover renderer
entry points via a single `using SnapshotAssertions.Render;`.

**Document version:** v0.2 (2026-05-07). Changes from v0.1: codified the family rule against
promoting Verify; added polling-loop default-schedule agreement; added `ToSnapshotString()`
format-version header rule; added test-projects-only scope blockquote as a binding
cross-repo convention; codified TFM policy (LTS-anchored; multi-target during STS support
windows); expanded the `CancellationToken` plumbing rule with provider-driven polling-sleep
semantics.

## Naming patterns

| Pattern | Purpose | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `HasX()` | Positive assertion entry point | `HasLogged()`, `HasStatusCode(200)` |
| `HasNotX()` / `IsNotX()` | Negative assertion entry point | `HasNotLogged()`, `IsNotStatusCode(200)` |
| `WithX(...)` | Filter / refinement chained on a parent assertion | `.WithException<T>()`, `.WithPath("/foo")` |
| `IsX()` | Value-shape assertion | `IsOk()`, `IsRecent(TimeSpan)` |
| `AndX()` | Value-returning terminator (returns the matched value) | `AndBody<T>()`, `GetMatch()` |
| `MatchesX(...)` | Comparison against a baseline / snapshot | `MatchesSnapshot()`, `MatchesSnapshotFile(path)` |
| `WithinTimeBudget(TimeSpan)` | Cross-cutting timing budget on any chain (compose via `.And`) | `.And.WithinTimeBudget(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500))` |
| `Dump*(...)` | Non-asserting inspection (writes diagnostic output) | `DumpToTestOutput()`, `DumpTo(TextWriter)` |

## `StringComparison` rule

Every public string-matching API requires the caller to pass `StringComparison` explicitly.
No silent culture defaults. Internal string equality where comparison semantics are unambiguous
(file paths on the platform, line endings) uses `StringComparison.Ordinal`. Meziantou.Analyzer
enforces this via MA0006 / MA0001.

## Async pattern + `CancellationToken` plumbing

Every assertion chain is `await`-able end-to-end. No `.Result`, no `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`,
no sync-over-async. Every async public API accepts `CancellationToken ct = default` (additive
overload where the existing API didn't); defaulting to `default` keeps existing call-sites
unaffected.

For polling, looping, or internal-timeout APIs, the additional rules are:

- Call `ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()` at the top of every poll iteration. Don't wait
  for the next sleep to surface cancellation.
- For sleep / delay between iterations, use `Task.Delay(interval, ct)` for cancellation
  cleanup. When a `TimeProvider?` is supplied non-null on the API, see the polling-loop
  default-schedule section below for the provider-driven variant.
- For internal-timeout APIs (e.g. `WithinHardTimeBudget(TimeSpan)`), create the internal
  `CancellationTokenSource(timeout)` and link it with the supplied external CT via
  `CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(externalCt, internalCts.Token)`. Either
  source firing aborts the operation; consumer-side intent is preserved.

## `TimeProvider` injection convention

Every API that involves waiting, polling, or wall-clock time accepts an optional `TimeProvider`
parameter. When omitted, the default is `TimeProvider.System`. This makes deterministic
fake-time testing (`Microsoft.Extensions.Time.Testing.FakeTimeProvider`) trivial: pass it as
the optional parameter and the assertion uses `timeProvider.GetTimestamp()` /
`timeProvider.GetElapsedTime(...)` for monotonic measurement.

`TimeAssertions.TUnit` is the canonical implementation of this convention. Every sibling
package's timing-related API accepts `TimeProvider` independently; no shared dependency.

## Polling-loop default-schedule agreement

`LogAssertions.WithinTimeout` and `TimeAssertions.Eventually` (and any future polling
terminator across the family) follow an explicit, fully-pinned schedule. Each package
implements independently (the family rule forbids cross-package code reference); the
convention pins the schedule so consumers see uniform behaviour without literal code
sharing.

**Schedule.** Exponential schedule: 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, then 1000ms cap. Escalates
one step per failed poll. Resets to 100ms on a true poll. Both axes pinned (multiplier and
trigger) so two independent implementations cannot drift in cadence.

**Provider-driven polling sleep.** When the supplied `TimeProvider?` parameter is non-null,
the polling sleep MUST use `Task.Delay(interval, timeProvider, ct)` (the static `Task.Delay`
overload accepting a `TimeProvider`, available .NET 8+) rather than `Task.Delay(interval,
ct)`. This is required for `FakeTimeProvider` to drive the polling loop deterministically: a
wall-clock `Task.Delay` ignores `Advance(...)` and the loop never re-evaluates the predicate
when the consumer expected fake-time progression to do so. When `TimeProvider?` is null,
falls back to `Task.Delay(interval, ct)`. If `Task.Delay(TimeSpan, TimeProvider,
CancellationToken)` doesn't satisfy the polling shape for some future requirement, fall back
to a timer-built wait via `timeProvider.CreateTimer(...)` plus a `TaskCompletionSource`. Same
rule applies to `EveryWindow`, `WithinHardTimeBudget`, and any future polling/timer-driven
family API.

## `ToSnapshotString()` format-version header

Family rendering helpers (e.g. `LogAssertions.ToSnapshotString()`) emit a fixed header line
as the first line of the output: `# <Package> snapshot v<N>`. The header is part of the
deterministic format, not metadata: it appears in every committed snapshot.

Format-version bumps (added field, reordered output, etc.) increment the version number
(`v2`, `v3`...) and are **always a major-version bump on the package itself**. Consumers'
committed snapshots therefore carry an explicit format-version marker that survives `git
diff` review and lets a future `MatchesSnapshot` rendering detect format-incompatibility
cleanly rather than silently failing on a one-line drift.

## `[EditorBrowsable(Never)]` on assertion bases

Required-public types (CRTP base classes that exist only to satisfy TUnit's
`[AssertionExtension]` source-generator constraints) are tagged
`[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]` and documented as
"not for external derivation." They appear in the public API surface for binary-compat
reasons but are hidden from IntelliSense.

## Namespace strategy

| Type / member | Namespace | Auto-imported? |
|---|---|---|
| Source-generated assertion entry points (`HasLogged()`, `MatchesSnapshot()`, `WithinTimeBudget()`, `IsApproximatelyEqualTo()`, etc.) | `TUnit.Assertions.Extensions` | Yes (TUnit auto-imports) |
| Shorthand entry points | `TUnit.Assertions.Extensions` | Yes (same path) |
| Internal types (matchers, options, builders) | Package's own namespace (`SnapshotAssertions`, `LogAssertions`, `TimeAssertions`, `MathAssertions`, `JsonAssertions`, ...) | No (needs explicit `using`) |
| Text renderer entry points: types whose role is to project a domain object into a deterministic string for `MatchesSnapshot()` | `SnapshotAssertions.Render` | No (needs `using SnapshotAssertions.Render;`) |

### `SnapshotAssertions.Render` for sibling-package renderers

Sibling family packages publish their text renderers under the shared `SnapshotAssertions.Render` namespace in their own assemblies. The shape is namespace-shared, not type-shared: each package owns its renderer types, and the types co-exist by sharing the namespace name across assemblies. Cross-assembly partial classes do not compose, so no package publishes a "renderer hub" static class for siblings to extend.

`SnapshotAssertions` itself reserves the namespace via an internal anchor type. The convention exists to give consumers a single `using SnapshotAssertions.Render;` directive that surfaces renderer entry points from every family package present in the test project.

## Cross-package references rule

No sibling family package may appear as a `PackageReference` in another sibling's
production `.csproj`. Composition patterns are implemented via pure functions returning
standard delegates / types (`Func<T, string>`, `Func<T, bool>`, BCL types) that the
consumer calls into the sibling package at their own call site.

Test projects MAY reference sibling packages to integration-verify the composition
end-to-end. Concretely:

| Project layer | Sibling-package reference allowed? |
|---|---|
| `src/<Family>.csproj` (core production) | NO |
| `src/<Family>.TUnit.csproj` (adapter production) | NO |
| `tests/<Family>.Tests/` (framework-agnostic core tests) | YES — sibling CORE packages only; sibling adapters NOT allowed (would defeat the framework-agnostic positioning) |
| `tests/<Family>.TUnit.Tests/` (adapter tests) | YES — any sibling package (core or adapter) |
| `tests/<Family>.AotConsumer/` (AOT smoke test) | YES — any sibling package |

Pack-time CI validation enforces the production-side rule: the NuGet package's
dependency list (verified at pack time + on nuget.org) must NOT contain any
sibling-family package as a dependency. Test-project sibling references are
conventions, not pack-time enforced, but reviewable in PR.

## Naming invariant

No sibling-package-name prefix may appear in another sibling's public API.

- `Snapshot...` typenames and member names belong to `SnapshotAssertions` only
- `Log...` typenames and member names belong to `LogAssertions` only
- `Math...` typenames and member names belong to `MathAssertions` only
- `Time...` typenames and member names belong to `TimeAssertions` only
- `Json...` typenames and member names belong to `JsonAssertions` only
- `Sse...` typenames and member names belong to `SseAssertions` only
- `Grpc...` typenames and member names belong to `GrpcAssertions` only

Applies to typenames AND method names AND extension method names in the
package's PublicAPI surface. The family's verb-naming convention is what's
being protected — extension methods are still public API and follow the
same rule.

Bounded exceptions (strict whitelist):

- BCL types are fine as parameter / return types anywhere (e.g.,
  `JsonTypeInfo<T>` from `System.Text.Json` doesn't trip the rule because
  its leading prefix is `Json*` AND it's BCL-shipped, not family-branded)
- Internal types within a package may use any name if not exposed publicly
- Additional exceptions require explicit `CONVENTIONS.md` entry with
  justification. Initial v0.6 whitelist: empty. Each future exception is
  considered case-by-case and added explicitly.

Composition between packages happens via standard BCL types and delegates
(`Func<T, string>`, `IDisposable`, etc.), never via sibling-branded types
appearing in another package's surface.

Pack-time CI validation enforces this: the package's PublicAPI snapshot
must not contain `Snapshot*`, `Log*`, `Math*`, `Time*`, `Json*`, `Sse*`,
or `Grpc*` as a leading prefix on typenames, method names, or extension
method names exposed publicly (with the strict whitelist above).

## Per-package strict-scope policy

Each family package has an explicit scope statement that bounds what
domain it asserts on. Scope boundaries are enforced by the **Naming
invariant** above (no sibling-prefix leakage) and the **Cross-package
references rule** (no sibling-package `PackageReference` in production).
Each package's README opens with its scope statement under the
test-projects-only blockquote.

| Package | Scope statement |
|---|---|
| `LogAssertions.TUnit` | Captured log records: levels, messages, properties, exception types, ordering. Composed via `Func<LogRecord, bool>` predicates. |
| `SnapshotAssertions.TUnit` | Deterministic text-snapshot matching against committed `.snapshot` files. Format-agnostic; assertion target is the produced string. |
| `TimeAssertions.TUnit` | `TimeProvider`-based timing assertions and the `WithinTimeBudget(TimeSpan)` cross-cutting modifier. Determinism via `FakeTimeProvider`. |
| `MathAssertions.TUnit` | Approximate-numeric and geometric tolerance: `IsApproximatelyEqualTo(value, tolerance)`, pose / vector / matrix tolerance. |
| `JsonAssertions.TUnit` | JSON content assertions over `System.Text.Json`: path / value / shape on `JsonDocument`, HTTP-response JSON, and `JsonSerializerContext`-registered types. |
| `SseAssertions.TUnit` | Server-Sent Events wire-format assertions: event-count, field shape (`event:`, `data:`, `id:`, `retry:`), and stream content validation. |
| `GrpcAssertions.TUnit` | gRPC call outcomes: `RpcException` presence, `StatusCode`, and `Status.Detail`. Transport-level status, not Protobuf message structure. |

The policy goal is "high-quality niche per package", not exhaustive
ecosystem coverage. Domains that fall outside the per-package scope
statements are out of family scope; they are not folded into an existing
package. The roster cap is reviewed before each revision and currently
sits at seven; revisions require a strict-scope-distinct domain (per this
section) and are not driven by adoption-growth reasoning.

## Dependency policy

Family packages depend by default only on the .NET BCL, TUnit (adapter packages), and their
own core package. An external runtime dependency is allowed only when it is **intrinsic** to
the asserted domain (the public surface is typed against the dependency's types, so a
home-grown substitute would not compile against real consumer values), carries a **permissive,
MIT-compatible license**, and is **disclosed** in the package README and `SECURITY.md`.
`GrpcAssertions.TUnit` is the first and only package to take one: the Apache-2.0
`Grpc.Core.Api` (`RpcException` / `StatusCode` / `Status`). The other six remain
BCL-and-TUnit-only.

## Core+adapter packaging rule

Family packages choose one of two shapes at v0.0.1, documented in each
package's README:

| Package | Shape |
|---|---|
| `LogAssertions.TUnit` | core (`LogAssertions`) + adapter (`LogAssertions.TUnit`) |
| `SnapshotAssertions.TUnit` | core (`SnapshotAssertions`) + adapter (`SnapshotAssertions.TUnit`) |
| `TimeAssertions.TUnit` | core (`TimeAssertions`) + adapter (`TimeAssertions.TUnit`) |
| `MathAssertions.TUnit` | core (`MathAssertions`) + adapter (`MathAssertions.TUnit`) |
| `JsonAssertions.TUnit` | single-package (only `JsonAssertions.TUnit`) |
| `SseAssertions.TUnit` | core (`SseAssertions`) + adapter (`SseAssertions.TUnit`) |
| `GrpcAssertions.TUnit` | core (`GrpcAssertions`) + adapter (`GrpcAssertions.TUnit`) |

**Core+adapter** ships the framework-agnostic primitives (parsers,
comparison enums, failure-message factories, deterministic renderers) in
a sibling `<Package>` core nupkg, and the TUnit-coupled assertion
methods + `[GenerateAssertion]` entry points in `<Package>.TUnit`. Six
of seven packages take this shape because the core primitives have value
outside the TUnit adapter (consumer-level composition, sibling-test
reuse, framework-agnostic test reuse).

**Single-package** ships only `<Package>.TUnit` with no separate core.
`JsonAssertions.TUnit` is the sole single-package member: the
JSON-comparison primitives are thin enough that splitting would produce
a near-empty core, and `System.Text.Json` already provides the
deterministic primitives.

The choice is per-package and is reviewed at v0.0.1; once shipped, the
shape is fixed. A single-package member adding a separate core later
would be a major-version bump and a CHANGELOG `### BREAKING` callout.

## No reflection policy

Family packages use no runtime reflection in the assertion path. The only acceptable
reflection-based code is convenience overloads (e.g. JSON deserialization for non-AOT
scenarios), which must be explicitly annotated with `[RequiresUnreferencedCode]` and
`[RequiresDynamicCode]` so AOT consumers see the warning at the call site.

`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers` enforces this at build time via a per-repo
`BannedSymbols.txt` listing reflection APIs.

## Test-projects-only scope

Every README in every family repo opens with the blockquote:

```markdown
> **Scope:** Test projects only. Not intended for production code.
```

This is binding across:
- The repo-level root `README.md`
- Each per-package `src/<Package>/README.md` (the one packed into the `.nupkg` and shown
  on nuget.org)

The scope statement appears immediately after the H1 title (and after CI badges in the
root README, before the package description).

## TFM policy

Family packages always target the **current LTS** of .NET. While a non-LTS (STS) release is in
support, packages multi-target the current LTS *plus* the current STS. When the next LTS ships,
both the previous LTS and the previous STS are dropped on the same release; the new LTS becomes
the single target until its STS sibling appears the following November.

| Window (approximate dates) | Target frameworks |
|---|---|
| Now, .NET 10 LTS only (Nov 2025 to Nov 2026) | `net10.0` |
| .NET 11 STS in support (Nov 2026 to Nov 2027) | `net10.0;net11.0` |
| .NET 12 LTS ships, drop 10 + 11 (Nov 2027 to Nov 2028) | `net12.0` |
| .NET 13 STS in support (Nov 2028 to Nov 2029) | `net12.0;net13.0` |
| ... | ... |

The TFM rotation lands at major-version boundaries (`2.0`, `3.0`, ...). Consumers who need an
older TFM pin to an older package version. Wide multi-targeting (e.g. `net8;net9;net10`) is not
used; the goal is "current LTS, plus current STS while it exists" with no long historical tails.

## Verify is not promoted

The family does NOT promote [Verify](https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify) in any
documentation, plan, README, or example. Rendering helpers (e.g. `ToSnapshotString()`)
produce framework-agnostic strings; the canonical example pipes to
`Assert.That(s).MatchesSnapshot()` (using `SnapshotAssertions.TUnit`), never to
`await Verify(s)`.

Verify is acceptable in consumer code that needs object-graph diffing (its core
competency); the family coexists with Verify but does not actively recommend or push
consumers toward it. The reason: `SnapshotAssertions.TUnit` exists specifically to
provide a coverage-friendly, AOT-first text-snapshot tool that avoids the Verify+MTP
coverage interaction on Linux runners, and promoting Verify in family documentation
would directly contradict that founding rationale.

## CHANGELOG conventions

Each repo's `CHANGELOG.md` follows [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The rules below codify what that means in practice across the family.

**Content rules:**

1. **User-facing only.** A CHANGELOG entry describes what changed for consumers: API
   additions or changes, behavioural changes, bug fixes a consumer can hit, dependency bumps
   with a transitive effect. Internal refactors with no behavioural change, test-only
   tweaks, and dev-dependency bumps with no transitive effect belong in commit messages,
   not the CHANGELOG.
2. **Only the six Keep a Changelog headers.** `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`,
   `Fixed`, `Security`. No `Notes` / `Documentation` / `Tests` / `Quality` sections; doc
   changes that affect consumers go under `Changed`, and test / coverage changes do not
   belong in the CHANGELOG at all (rule 1).
3. **Standard header order within each version section.** `Added` → `Changed` → `Deprecated`
   → `Removed` → `Fixed` → `Security`. Within a header, list entries by significance, not
   alphabetically.

**Stylistic rules:**

4. Past-tense active voice, one change per bullet: "Added X", "Fixed Y", "Changed Z" — not
   "X has been added" or "Will be removed in 2.0".
5. Lead each bullet with the affected API in `code` formatting: ``HasJsonProperty`` now
   returns ``AssertionResult`` instead of ``bool``. ...
6. Mark breaking changes prominently: either a `### BREAKING` callout at the top of the
   version section, or a `**BREAKING:**` prefix on the affected bullet.
7. Don't edit published version sections. A shipped `## [0.1.0]` section is a historical
   record; corrections go in a newer section.
8. ISO 8601 dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`.
9. `## [Unreleased]` is always present at the top of the file. At release time, rename it
   to the version section and add a new `## [Unreleased]` above it.
10. Keep the reference-link footer (`[unreleased]: ...` / `[x.y.z]: ...`) in lockstep with
    every version bump.

## `PackageReleaseNotes` auto-extract from CHANGELOG

Each repo ships an identical `Directory.Build.targets` at the repo root that auto-populates
`<PackageReleaseNotes>` at pack time from the matching `## [<Version>]` section in
`CHANGELOG.md`. nuget.org's Release Notes tab is driven by `<PackageReleaseNotes>` (not by
shipping `CHANGELOG.md` in the nupkg) so this is the mechanism that surfaces the per-version
notes on nuget.org.

The mechanism is a `RoslynCodeTaskFactory` inline C# task that runs `BeforeTargets="GenerateNuspec"`:
it reads `CHANGELOG.md`, matches `^## \[<Version>\]`, captures the body up to the next
`## [` or end-of-file, prepends a `View the rendered release notes: <url>` line pointing at
the matching GitHub Release, and overrides `PackageReleaseNotes` when a section is found.
When no matching section is found, the task emits an MSBuild Warning and the csproj fallback
is preserved.

The prepended URL exists because nuget.org renders the Release Notes tab as plaintext-with-line-breaks
rather than rendered markdown ([NuGet/NuGetGallery#8889](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8889)
is the open feature request; the linked issue is the source of truth for current status). The
prepended URL gives consumers a one-click route to the rendered-markdown version of the same
notes on GitHub.

Every csproj's `<PackageReleaseNotes>` carries this fallback for the no-match case:

```xml
<PackageReleaseNotes>$(RepositoryUrl)/releases/tag/v$(Version)</PackageReleaseNotes>
```

`$(RepositoryUrl)` is set in `Directory.Build.props`; nuget.org auto-links the URL, so a
consumer one-clicks through to the corresponding GitHub Release (release notes are
auto-generated there via the release workflow). This handles both bare-package csprojs and
adapter-package csprojs in repos that have two.

Two caveats consumers should know:

- nuget.org renders the Release Notes tab as plaintext-with-line-breaks, not as rendered
  markdown. Bullets show as literal `- foo`; headers as literal `### foo`. URLs auto-link,
  blank lines preserve. Still vastly better than "See CHANGELOG.md" but not pretty.
- Only future releases benefit. nupkgs on nuget.org are immutable; an already-shipped
  release continues to display the original `<PackageReleaseNotes>` value forever.
